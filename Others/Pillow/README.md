# Pillow Basics

First, you need to install the [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) package:

```bash
$ python -m pip install Pillow
```

We use Pillow instead of the others libraries when we want to perform high-level manipulation (make some exploration on the image for processing)

**PS:** You'll use PIL when you're using the library (but you're using Pillow which is a fork of PIL original library)
