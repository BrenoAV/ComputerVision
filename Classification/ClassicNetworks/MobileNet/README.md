# MobilNet

- **Framework:** TensorFlow
- **Dataset:** Cats-Dogs (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chetankv/dogs-cats-images)
- **Paper Link:** https://paperswithcode.com/paper/mobilenets-efficient-convolutional-neural
- The Mobile Architecture performed an acc score of ~ 70%
- I tried to comment some part of the MobileNet Architecture, and tried to decrease quantity of filter. But it's not enough to the model enter into overfitting. Maybe trying to add L2 regularizes could work it or decrease more the quantity of filters.
